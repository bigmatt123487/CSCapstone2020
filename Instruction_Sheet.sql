--This is a Comment
--Thank you for reading this, this SQL file was created by Joseph Maxwell
--This SQL file is designed to build a new database from nothing.
--If you are doing this, it should either be when you are moving to a new computer or the previous database has failed.
--Please run this file in SQL Server Management Studio, all instructions are given with this program in mind

--Quick start: to run a statement, you select and highlight the statement and press f5
--             A stament is a list of commands ended by a ";", so please highlight from the beginning to the ";".
--If you get an error about permissions, check that you are running in administrator mode.

--WARNING: DROP will delete ALL data in the database, please back-up the database first if possible
--1:To start, we should start with a clean slate, DROP DATABASE will remove all traces of the database and allow for a clean reconstruction.
DROP DATABASE DLC;

--2:Create new(empty) database
CREATE DATABASE DLC;

--3:Selects the database to be affected by future changes
--NOTE: Always run this line at least once before modifying the database
USE DLC;

--4:Creates tables and defines the variables used within each
--highlight from Start to END and press F5
--START A1
